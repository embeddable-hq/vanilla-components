# Starter Components

Hello and welcome to your custom repository built just for you by the Embeddable team ❤️ We wish to thank you for being one of the first to use the platform and welcome any feedback you might have.

### Installation

`npm i` # requires node 18 or later

### Build & Deploy
This is how you push code changes to your Embeddable workspace

`npm run embeddable:login`

`npm run embeddable:build`

`npm run embeddable:push`

`open https://app.embeddable.com`

### Local Development
This is a "Preview workspace" (local to you) that allows you make changes locally and see them instantly without needing to "Build and Deploy".

`npm run embeddable:login`

`npm run embeddable:dev` # opens a "Preview" workspace, that uses your local components and models
